# My reflections on what i learned in Github and GitCLI :sparkle:
## A Terminal/CLI (Command-Line-Interface) is a text based interface to the computer.
you can type commands in it: *git push (pushes changes to an establised git repository) * ls -a (shows all files, even hidden ones) * code . (opens vscode)

using special commands like _clone_ and _git add_ you can modify files that are hosted online on a website, like github, from inside a CLI application, such as Git (_Global Information Tracker_)
## Git is a system used to track the modification, diistribution, and progress of code from a codebase on your computer. _used for version control._
## GitHub is online hosting service where anyone can host **Git Repositories**, acting as a showcase for your code. it is built around git and the internet, making collaboration easy.

Based upon what i've learned so far, learning the basics in git/github is fundamental to coding as a skill; it is a foundational tool for professional developers of code.
I can imagine this tool and anything related to it to be useful in creating tools for a website or program of any kind. The general nature of this work is indicitive of its usefulness.
in conclusion i see very little in opposition to these being essential tools in the development of software or the consistency of code in a collaborative environment, such as in this class.

[i imagine naming the amount of things git isnt useful for would be way shorter than the list of things its useful for.] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakpx.com%2Fen%2Fhd-wallpaper-desktop-gdvzd&psig=AOvVaw2vRcHUQx8OjnrJHzf5EhBu&ust=1706712638440000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCOCQjPW-hYQDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)
